If you find any bugs, please file them in\n  the bug tracker here: https://github.com/Monnoroch/ColorHighlighter/issues. I always appreciate your help and try to fix\n  problems as soon as possible.\n  \n  The plugin is being developed by me alone in my spare time, so if you want to encourage me to build it\n  better and faster, donations as always welcome.\n  \n  Thank you guys for your support, every little bit helps!\n\n\nFile History\n------------\n\n  File History\n  ============\n  \n  Provides access to the history of accessed files - project-wise or globally.\n  The most recently closed file can be instantly re-opened with a keyboard\n  shortcut. Furthermore, you can search through the entire file history with a\n  quick panel (including file preview and the ability to open multiple files).\n  \n  For a changelog, see CHANGELOG.md.\n  \n  Usage\n  -----\n  \n  To use the plugin, open the Command Palette and search for `File History:`. You\n  can see the default key bindings in the palette, or alternatively browse\n  \"Preferences > Package Settings > File History > Key Bindings - Default\" in the\n  menu.\n  \n  \n  More Information\n  ----------------\n  \n  View more information like images or the exact commands and parameters on the\n  github page: https://github.com/FichteFoll/FileHistory (or in README.md).\n\n\nInno Setup\n----------\n\n  If you're using Inno Setup on Windows, it is recommended to also install\n  SublimeLinter and this plugin to highlight errors in your Inno Setup script:\n  \n      “SublimeLinter”, a linter for Sublime Text\n      https://packagecontrol.io/packages/SublimeLinter\n  \n      “SublimeLinter-contrib-iscc”, Inno Setup plugin\n      https://packagecontrol.io/packages/SublimeLinter-contrib-iscc\n\n\nJavaScript Completions\n----------------------\n\n  JavaScript Completions Package\n  ===============================\n  \n  🎉🎉 ANNOUNCEMENT - NEW PLUGIN \"JavaScript Enhancements\" RELEASED 🎉🎉\n  =======================================================================\n  \n  I developed a new plugin with new features thanks to Flow (javascript static type checker from Facebook).\n  \n  So, I will NO LONGER SUPPORT \"JavaScript Completions\" plugin, except in particular cases. \n  I'm going to focus only on this new one!\n  \n  You can find it on: 👉👉 https://github.com/pichillilorenzo/JavaScriptEnhancements 👈👈\n  \n  This new plugin offers not only a BETTER AUTOCOMPLETE but a lot of FEATURES about creating, \n  developing and managing javascript projects, such as:\n  \n  - JavaScript real-time errors\n  - Code Refactoring\n  - Local bookmarks project\n  - Cordova projects (run cordova emulate, build, compile, serve, etc. directly from Sublime Text!)\n  - Ionic v1 and v2 (it includes also v3) projects (same as Cordova projects!)\n  - Angular v1 and v2 (it includes also v4 and v5) projects\n  - Vue projects (only about the creation at this moment)\n  - React projects (only about the creation at this moment)\n  - React Native projects (only about the creation at this moment.
